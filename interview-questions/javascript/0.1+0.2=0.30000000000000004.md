```js
console.log(0.1 + 0.2) // 0.30000000000000004
console.log(0.1 + 0.2 === 0.3) // false
```

See https://0.30000000000000004.com/ and [IEEE-754 Floating Point Converter](https://www.h-schmidt.net/FloatConverter/IEEE754.html).

Because in the binary word, the only prime factor is 2, so only `1/2`, `1/4`, `1/8` would be expressed cleanly as decimals.

# What If You Need Accuracy?

## Only use integers to represent numbers

For example, to represent 19.99.

```js
const priceInt = 1999
const priceString = String(1999)
const priceCurrency = `${priceString.slice(0, -2)}.${priceString.slice(-2)}`
console.log(priceCurrency) // 19.99
```
