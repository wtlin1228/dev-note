# Chapter 1. What Is Software Engineering?

"Software engineering is programming integrated over time."

- programming tasks: only development, often an act of individual creation
- software engineering tasks: development, modification and maintenance, a team effort

This distinction is at the core of what we call **sustainability** for software. Your project is sustainable if, for the expected life span of your software, you are capable of reacting to whatever valuable change comes along, for either technical or business reasons.

We can also say that software engineering is different from programming in terms of the complexity of decisions that need to be made and their stakes. In software engineering, we are regularly forced to evaluate the trade-offs between several paths forward, sometimes with high stakes and often with imperfect value metrics. The job of a software engineer, or a software engineering leader, is to aim for sustainability and management of the scaling costs for the organization, the product, and the development workflow. With those inputs in mind, evaluate your trade-offs and make rational decisions. We might sometimes defer maintenance changes, or even embrace policies that don’t scale well, with the knowledge that we’ll need to revisit those decisions. Those choices should be explicit and clear about the deferred costs.

"It’s programming if ‘clever’ is a compliment, but it’s software engineering if ‘clever’ is an accusation."
