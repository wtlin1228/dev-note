# The problems of technical documents that need to be solved

- Engineering stuckness

  It's the key problem that when engineers get stuck and they want to use documentation to get unstuck, then you wanna help them fast. And they want to get unstuck fast, so that really is the key problem underneath all this.

- Trust

  How can you trust what you find?

- Discoverability and Findability

  Findability, you know what you’re looking for, that’s search.

  Discoverability, you don’t know what you’re looking for, but you want to discover it.

- Tech doc at scale

  You got 1,500 engineers, but you can't have 100 technical writers. How do we solve this?

- Maintenance

  It's very easy to create documents, but how do you maintain it afterwards?

- Feedback loop

  That is about that somebody making comments on a piece of documentation, that those comments would get to the one who, or the team who, owns that documentation and they will correct it and then you get a feedback loop.

- Hidden knowledge

  That’s many engineers having lots of knowledge that’s in their heads and it’s not shared.

- Used and Useful

  I think teams who create documentation really wanna know that it’s used and that it’s useful for their own, you know, they put a lot of work into putting some documentation up and they need to know.

- Ownership

  Ownership is a bit connected to no handover process. Documentation has to be owned. If it’s not owned, it will absolutely decay over time. And then a handover process needs to be in place otherwise you won’t have ownership eventually.

- Adoption and Engagement

  that’s about there are often different use cases, and different needs, you have to think about that you can’t just ignore that.

- No handover process

# The success factors of docs-like-code in Spotify

- Fully embraced docs like code

  We fully embraced Docs Like Code. We didn’t say, “Oh yeah, we’re gonna do Docs Like Code, “but if you wanna Confluence, that’s okay.” No, we’ve been really opinionated and we’ve standardized and centralized and said, “No, it’s Docs Like Code. That’s the way we’re going.

- Clear and inspiring vision

  We had a clear and inspiring vision, which is this: **Spotifiers using technical documentation go from stuck to unstuck in less than a minute**.

- Cross-functional team
- Solving a real problem

  We were solving a real problem in the organization. The organization was hungry for this, it was almost desperate, so we really filled a hole.

- Good adoption

  Good adoption, that’s given us confidence going forward.

- Experienced PM
- Quick development of a MLP

  We had a quick development of a minimum, lovable product.

- Able to build on existing technology
- Own the problem and solution

  At Spotify, we get to own the problem and the solution. That’s meant that we can be opinionated and say that this is the way to technical documentations at Spotify, there is no other way.
