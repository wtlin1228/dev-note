# Scaling Frontend Application Development

> Iteration velocity solves all known problems.

That's the only thing that we know is that the future is uncertain and we have to deal with that fact professionally. And the way how you do that professionally is by being able, at the moment when you make that mistake to react to it and iterate and do it right the second time around. So with that, let's think a little bit about our role in this, and for the rest of this talk.

## Principle 1: Tear down the barriers

## Principle 2: Make it easy to delete code

## Principle 3: Migrate incrementally

## Principle 4: Always get better, never get worse

## Principle 5: Embrace lack of knowledge

## Principle 6: Eliminate systematic complexity
