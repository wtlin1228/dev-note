### Policies That Don’t Scale

Most commonly, these can be identified by considering the work imposed on a single engineer and imagining the organization scaling up by 10 or 100 times. When we are 10 times larger,

- will we add 10 times more work with which our sample engineer needs to keep up?
- does the amount of work our engineer must perform grow as a function of the size of the organization?
- does the work scale up with the size of the codebase?

If either of these are true, do we have any mechanisms in place to automate or optimize that work? If not, we have scaling problems.

For example: "the traditional use of development branches" and "the traditional approach to deprecation"
