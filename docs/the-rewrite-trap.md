Bad reasons for the big rewrite:

1. You don't need to learn new concepts
2. Follow your mental model
3. Work the way you want

Before big rewrite, do:

1. defer judgement, assume best intentions, and learn
2. formalise what you don't understand and have open discussions
3. get to know the system that led to the current way of working before you attempt to change it
