The trend of styling the frontend application is:

    CSS -> SASS -> CSS-in-JS -> Zero runtime CSS-in-JS

# Why CSS-in-JS?

CSS is not type-safe.

type-safe means:

- Type-checking
- Goto-definition
- Safe refactoring
- Used code detection
- Typed design tokens

# Styles Output: Runtime stylesheets vs Static CSS extraction

![full cache](./images/full-cache.png)

## When to use them

Use runtime stylesheets if you want to get faster First Paint metrics. Like CSR / SPA.

Use static CSS extraction if you want less bytes to be transferred and better caching. Like SSR.

# Linaria

Linaria is a zero-runtime CSS-in-JS library and looks very promising. But it's really poor documented (2023/02/12).
