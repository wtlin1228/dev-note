There are three board categories of content localization.

Translate content.

Platforms that provide efficient localization workflows:

- [crowdin](https://crowdin.com/)
- [lokalise](https://lokalise.com/)

## Different Experiences

Often on key landing pages, create locale-specific imagery or content.

# Problem

But localizing web experiences can be a huge pain.

1. Copying and pasting themes slows development and introduces bugs
2. Workflow inefficiencies multiply 1:1, what took a day for one site now takes two days for two sites

## Developers get stuck with huge maintenance workloads...

Dev work required for every localized site for every change ðŸ˜…

So, ... leaving content and integration updates in localization limbo.

# Solutions

Three common strategies for website localization

## Page-level localization

### When to use

- You need a completely different page layout for each locale -
  For example, to entirely remove a section for the French audience Vs. English

### When to consider another strategy

- When you need to to scale the same content to many channels (SMS, in-store, voice)
- When blocks of content stay the same, but what's within each changes based on locale

## Block-level localization

### When to use

- When the structure is the same across locales, but images, color, text, etc.
  should change

### When to consider another strategy

- When you need to to scale the same content to many channels (sMS, in-store, voice)

## Data model localization

### When to use

- When you need to to scale the same content to many channels (SMS, in-store, voice)
- When you are importing content from another localized CMs or data source

### When to consider another strategy

- You need a completely different page layout for each locale
