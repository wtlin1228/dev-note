# Holotypes

Each holotype application is accompanied by a rough category name, additional real-world examples, as well as the characteristics & constraints that define its architecture. Ideal implementation and delivery techniques are also provided, based on the architectural context.

## üì® PIM Applications

Holotype: Gmail
Examples: Google Calendar, Outlook.com, Fastmail
Characteristics: thick-client, infinite lists, embedded content, rich text editing, sanitization, MDI, storage, offline & sync, notifications
Constraints: extended session length, sensitive & largely uncacheable data, high security risk, often offline
Ideal Implementation: Single Page App with app shell caching.
Ideal Delivery: PWA in standalone display mode.

## üìù Productivity Applications

Holotype: Google Docs
Examples: Office.com, Zoho, Dropbox, Box
Characteristics: thick-client, rich text editing, offline & sync, filesystem, clipboard, storage, image manipulation, embedded content
Constraints: extended session length and multiple concurrent sessions favor client-side implementation.
Ideal Implementation: Single Page App. Consider app shell caching. Unload page between apps.
Ideal Delivery: PWA in standalone display mode.

## üéß Media Players

Holotype: Spotify
Examples: Youtube Music, Google Play Music, Tidal, Soundcloud, Pandora, Deezer
Characteristics: rich media, thick-client, infinite scrolling content, filtering & sorting, notifications, OS integration, offline, embeddability
Constraints: extended session length, playback must continue as the user navigates.
Ideal Implementation: Single Page App with app shell prerendering & caching. Server-render <head> for discovery.
Ideal Delivery: PWA in standalone display mode.

## üé® Graphical Editors

Holotype: Figma
Examples: AutoCAD, Tinkercad, Photopea, Polarr
Characteristics: 3D rendering & GPU, image manipulation, fullscreen & pointer capture, MDI, storage, offline, filesystem, threads, wasm
Constraints: long session length, sensitivity to input & rendering latency, large objects/files
Ideal Implementation: Single Page App. Separate lighter browsing UI from editor.
Ideal Delivery: PWA in standalone display mode.

## üë®‚Äçüé§ Media Editors

Holotype: Soundtrap
Examples: Looplabs
Characteristics: Audio processing, device integration (midi,usb), storage, offline, filesystem, threads, wasm
Constraints: long session length, low-latency DSP, low-latency media recording & playback, large file sizes/IO
Ideal Implementation: Single Page App. Separate lighter browsing UI from editor.
Ideal Delivery: PWA in standalone display mode.
